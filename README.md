# RPG-Battle-System
A short and simple command line text bases RPG battles system. It's not perfect, but it's a good project to learn with.

Never done a README but here goes.

To play the game, please download the RPG Battle Simulator zip file. Once downloaded, unzip the folder, and double click on the RPG Battle Engine exe file. The game should then
load up in a console window.

This has a basic save system that saves to a .txt document. There is a battle system, and a shop system. The game is currently unbalanced, so suggestions on how to better 
balance it are welcome. If you find any bugs, please let me know so I can fix them. Thank-you!
