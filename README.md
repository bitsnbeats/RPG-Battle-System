# RPG-Battle-System
A short and simple command line text bases RPG battles system. It's not perfect, but it's a good project to learn with.

Never done a README but here goes.

This has a basic save system that saves to a .txt document. There is a battle system, and a shop system. The game is currently unbalanced, so suggestions on how to better 
balance it are welcome. If you find any bugs, please let me know so I can fix them. Thank-you!
